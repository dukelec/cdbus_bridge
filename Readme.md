## CDBUS Bridge

The `CDBUS Bridge HS` is a USB-to-RS485 (CDBUS) adapter. The USB port supports `High-Speed`, and the RS485 interface supports up to 50 Mbps.

 - The two RS485 ports are internally straight-through, simplifying wiring.

 - S1.1: Force bootloader mode.
 - S1.2: In arbitration mode, the maximum limit of `baud_l`:  
         ON: Default 2 Mbps; OFF: Default 1 Mbps. (modifiable)
 - S2.1: Enable pull-up resistor.
 - S2.2: Enable termination resistor.
 - S2.3: Enable pull-down resistor.
 - S2.4: Enable 5V output.


## GUI Configuration

CDBUS GUI Tool: https://github.com/dukelec/cdbus_gui

When you open the serial port, specify the baud rate as `52685` (`0xcdcd`) to enter the configuration mode.

The target address should be set to `00:00:ff`.

After modifying the configuration, write 1 to `save_conf` to save the changes to flash.

To restore the default configuration, change the value of `magic_code` to a different value, save it to flash, and then power cycle the device.
